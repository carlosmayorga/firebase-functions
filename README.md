Important: The cloud functions was builts in TypeScript, so you need to open the Terminal and execute the command `tsc -w` into the folder Functions to compile the code, after in other Tab of your Terminal, execute `firebase serve` to startup the server in localhost.

To configure your Firebase Admin SDK, you need to go to the project settings of your project and go to Service Accounts option.
